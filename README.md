# code_summarization
This project leverages the advanced Gemini model to simplify understanding and analyzing large codebases. By aggregating code from multiple files into a single text file, the project allows the model to process the entire codebase, providing detailed summaries, explanations, and insights.
# What This Project Does
Combine Code Files: Puts all your code into one big file.
Use Gemini-small : Uses a powerful model to read and understand the code.
Ask Questions: Lets you ask the model about your code to get summaries and explanations.
